# rspec-sanity

Flaky tests reporter that wraps your `rspec` call designed for the CI systems.

### Motivation

Create opinionated statically typed wrapper on top of `rspec` instead of creating ad-hoc spaghetti of shell scripts every time at every company that is dealing with similar problem.

### Status

Early PoC. Very little tests and terrible code quality. Supports Github Issues and JIRA (with strong assumptions about how flakies are reported).

### How to use it?

_Docs pending_
